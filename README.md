# AI-Enhanced-Stock-Market-Prediction-Machine-Learning-Models-for-Forecasting-in-the-USA

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting stock market trends using historical data. By leveraging machine learning models and insightful data visualizations, the project aims to classify target outcomes effectively. The dataset includes key financial attributes such as `date`, `open`, `high`, `low`, `close`, `adjclose`, `volume`, and `ticker`, offering a robust foundation for analytical and predictive tasks.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and prepared the dataset for modeling, including handling data types, missing values, and feature selection.
- **Data Analysis and Visualization**:
  - Examined the distribution of trading volume, prices, and target classes.
  - Analyzed trends and correlations between financial attributes.
  - Visualized time series trends and class distributions to uncover actionable insights.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implemented three classification models—Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost—to predict target outcomes.
- **Model Comparison and Evaluation**:
  - Compared the performance of the models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores.
  - Visualized model performance metrics for better interpretability.
